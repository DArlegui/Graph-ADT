# Program 17: Graph-ADT
Graph ADT header files to closely examine these classes and their methods to manipulate graphs. I have chosen my animal crossing world. PowerPoint presentation included.

Instructions

Your Graph

Using any kind of editing software, such as PowerPoint or Keynote or Google Slides, imagine and draw a map of something interesting that would be well represented by a graph. Consider the problems we've seen in the book: a graph representing cities connected by airline routes; islands and bridges; a highway system; etc. Your graph must have at least 10 vertices. Be creative. Make your graph clear to understand and interesting. It should be very obvious what your graph is just by looking at it.

This map should be the first slide in a presentation and it should include vertices indicating roads, bridges, paths, etc. For your second slide, remove the map and just have the graph representation in it and don't forget weights. The third and fourth slides are created using the output data from your code in Part One below. The fifth through at least fourteenth are in Part Two, and the last slide is Part Three.
